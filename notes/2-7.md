# Memory

Things we percieve are categorized into two different categories of memory

1. Short term: fractions of seconds - minutes  
1. Long term: Hours, years, days

## Short term / working memory

Capacity: 3-5 unrelated items

* Goals, numbers, words, objects (more life features of objects)

New items can grab attention away from old ones  

**Design implication**: dont make users remember info across screens
**Design implication**: Allow users to see the instructions while they do things

## Long term

Long term memories are patters of neural actvity

* Experiences trigger patters corresponding to features of a memory
* The more times the pattern is recalled, the easiers it is to recognize and recal

Long term memory is faulty

* Error prone
* Prone to impression
* Memories change when features are dropped or added
* Seldom-follwed routines hard to recall
  * Recipes
  * Checklists for pilots

## Attentional Limits

Users barely pay attention to computer tools

* Focus their attention on own goals, data

Users think about computer UI superfically, intently focused on achieving their goal

When a user is focused on a task, they won't notice other things

* **Design implication**: Make changes obvious
