Hard to get requirements right  
Hard to translate requirements into usable and useful software  
Human behavior is unpredictable

Decreased sales  
Dissatisifed customers = negative perception  
Poor reviews  
Increased need for training  
Death/Catastrophe

* Therac-25 overdoses
* American Airlines Flight 965 crash
* Three-Mile island nuclear disaster

## Norman's design concepts

Design Concepts are Generalizable Abstractions

* Tells us what to provide and what not to provide in a UI

**Affordance**: The relationship between iteracting agent (user) and an object

* The object has properties that may inform the agent how to use it
* Agent has capabilities and intentions
* NOT a property on an object

*Ex*: Doorknobs afford (are for) turning

**Signifier**: A markerin, label, or indication of what can be done with an object or where action on object should take place
